Public Finance Field Requirements
---------------------------------

The Public Finance field requirement consists of two courses: [14.471](/courses/14-471-public-economics-i-fall-2012/) (Public Economics I) and 14.472 (Public Economics II). In some cases, 14.474 (Advanced Topics in Public Economics) may be combined with 14.471 to satisfy the field requirement.

Public Finance Seminar and Luncheon Meeting
-------------------------------------------

The Public Finance Seminar plays an important part in raising current "hot topics" and permitting students to meet some of the outstanding scholars in the field. Seminars take place once a week for one and a half hours. Schedules, seminar notices, and papers are available beforehand. The seminar is not restricted to thesis writers, and first and second year students are encouraged to attend. We also have an informal luncheon once a week where thesis writers present their work in progress; students planning to specialize in public finance are welcome to attend.
